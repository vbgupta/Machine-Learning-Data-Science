# EDA-Exoplanet-Database
# **About this Project**
As an Applied Data Science student focusing in Astronomy, the excitment of being able to combine the both fields to find Earth like planets (maybe the pontential for life) from data gather by telescopes is inspiring and motivating.

This is my attempt at analyzing this dataset.

# Findings

## No relationship between mass and orbital period of planet

## No relationship between mass and radius of planets at all!?

## The year 2016 was very good for Kepler. This was the year when most the exoplanets were found

## The Primary Transit technique found the most number of planets

## Water was found on many exoplanets discovered by Kepler

# Using specific parameters to filter out planets: (Planet Mass is btw 4.5 & 10 Earth Masses); (Planet Radius is btw 0.8 & 2.2 Earth Radius); (Star Age is between 4.5 and 10 billion years) so that life as we know it, may exist.

# Using mass of planets, radius of planets, and the age of star they orbit to filter further

# Most planets within these parameters were found by Primary Transit!
